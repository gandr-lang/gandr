//! The checking context: the core context the judgement goes under binders in,
//! wrapped with what the core context does not hold.
//!
//! # A wrapper, not an extension of the core context
//!
//! `gandr-core-term`'s [`Context`] is the flat, de Bruijn, name-free binder
//! stack, and it stays that. What checking adds sits here beside it: the
//! signature table from admission positions to the types declarations
//! supplied, the highest admission position so far, the atoms the literal and
//! unit rules hand out, and the step allowance. A later synthesised context
//! lands in this wrapper too, so no checking concern widens the core crate.
//!
//! # Resolution by admission position
//!
//! A declaration's type enters the signature table only after its own body
//! was judged, and a declaration is admitted only above every position already
//! admitted. A body therefore sees exactly the declarations strictly before
//! it: self-reference and mutual reference find no type, whatever the producer
//! resolved.
