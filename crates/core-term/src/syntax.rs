//! The core language: [`Value`] and [`Computation`] on the term side,
//! [`ValueType`] and [`CompType`] on the type side, and the zone-qualified
//! variable reference the two-zone context is read through.
//!
//! # The alphabet is the kernel's; the grammar is this crate's
//!
//! Levels, base types, literals, sum sides, de Bruijn indices and admission
//! positions are re-used from the trusted base rather than restated, so the two
//! languages cannot disagree about what a literal or a level *is* and the
//! erasure that carries a core term down to a kernel term stays an id remapping
//! rather than a payload translation.
//!
//! The node enums are this crate's own, and that is the half that matters: an
//! elaboration-only former — a mark, a typed hole, a pattern hole — enters here
//! rather than widening the vocabulary the kernel is obliged to represent,
//! whose closedness is one of the trusted base's stated properties.
//!
//! # A variable names its zone
//!
//! The context carries two zones, and a de Bruijn index counts binders within
//! one zone rather than across both, so an occurrence that did not say which
//! zone it counted in would be ambiguous. [`Value::Variable`] therefore carries
//! a [`Zone`] beside its index.
//!
//! No former in the core vocabulary binds into the linear zone, so the linear
//! spelling is reachable only through a context built directly. The zone stays
//! on every occurrence, so a former that binds linearly changes no occurrence
//! site.
//!
//! # Children are ids, and the derived relations are shallow
//!
//! A node's children are typed arena ids and leaf payloads stay inline, so the
//! derived `Clone`, `Drop`, `PartialEq`, `Eq` and `Hash` do not walk term
//! depth. The derived equality is child-id equality rather than structural
//! equality: two structurally equal subterms need not share an id, so every use
//! site either compares inline leaf payloads or resolves ids explicitly.
